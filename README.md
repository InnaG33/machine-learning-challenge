## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

This work demonstrates 3 machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset:

* Logistic Regression
* Grid Search SVC
* Deep Model

## Outcome 

Deep Model yielded classification predictions with the highest accuracy of 0.88.
